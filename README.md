The Default Apps setting is not exclusively new to Windows 10 but, much like many of the other Control Panel staples of previous versions, Microsoft has worked in an almost total rehaul of the old system in favor of something a little more streamlined and a lot more functional.

### Step-by-step instructions to manage default apps:

* Open the Settings app on your Android phone.
* Go into Apps.
* Select Default apps.
* Pick the apps you want for each option.

## How to Clear Default Apps ?

* Open Settings and tap Apps & notifications.
* Select Open all apps or See all [#] apps to see the full list of apps on your device.
* Scroll down and choose the app that you want to clear as the default.
* Tap Open by default.
* Tap CLEAR DEFAULTS to clear out the default actions that you set.
* After the defaults are cleared, the page refreshes and displays a No defaults set message, and the CLEAR DEFAULTS option is grayed out.
* The default actions that you set for that app are cleared, and you can assign another app as the default app for that action.
